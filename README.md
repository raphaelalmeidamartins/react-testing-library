# :test_tube: Tests with React Testing Library  :alembic:

## :page_with_curl: About

React testing project developed by [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/) at the end of Unit 14 ([Front-end Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/2_Desenvolvimento-Front-end)) of Trybe's Web Development course. I was approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to implement integration and unit tests with React Testing Library to a React project that was already developed.
